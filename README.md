# beat-shapes
Beat Shapes is a 2D endless runner game based on music. It is started as my thesis project. I made it using Unity.

## Gameplay
The player can choose a song and then starts the match. As an endless runner game, the player must go as far as possible avoiding obstacles and enemies, but when they touch him, the match will end. During the game the obstacles change their property to the rhythm of music (the selected song). For example they can become larger or shoot other obstacles against the character which can defend himself shooting projectiles that destroy the obstacles.

## Songs
The available songs in the game are:
- A Himitsu - Adventures
- Buddha - Kontekst
- DEAF KEV - Invincible
- Electro-Light - Symbolism
- Tobu - Candyland
- Tobu - Hope
- Tobu & Itro - Sunburst
- Vexento - We Are One


I chose them because they don't have any copyright and also they are really good to listen to during the game!
However the player can also choose to play with other songs that he might have saved on his computer (currently only work on Windows).

## Others
As I already said Beat Shapes initially was my thesis project, and now I'm still working on it during my free time.
